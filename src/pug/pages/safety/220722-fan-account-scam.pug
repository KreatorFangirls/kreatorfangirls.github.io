		p Everyone has so little patience these days and I suppose this is one reason why nobody caught on to this scam before. So we're jumping straight into the essential: looking at what may signal something's fishy with the fan accounts you may encounter.

				b Selling stuff. 
				| Major red flag, right off the bat. If they advertise, either in the posts or in the bio, that they're selling anything on a regular basis, red alert! Selling tickets to shows rescheduled over the past years is probably no reason to worry, but if they have a store, it's likely a scam.
			li
				b Using URL shorteners. 
				| There may be legitimate reasons for that, but if you see a zshorten.com, bit.ly, rebrand.ly, tinyurl.com, bl.ink URL in the bio or elsewhere, proceed with caution.
			li
				b Following: many! 
				| If the account you're looking at is following thousands of accounts, that's a major red flag. Following accounts en-masse is a common stategy to get attention and hopefully get a follow back.
			li
				b No credits, no explanations, no corrections, no interactions. 
				| Photos that have appeared online before get posted without saying who, when and where took them, just with an emoji and some meaningless text. Also, we all fuck up, but nothing ever happens as a result of someone pointing out something in the comments.
